## Getting Started With Collaboration

We will start by introducing you to Git, GitHub, and the collaboration features we will use throughout the class. Even if you have used GitHub in the past, we hope this information will provide a baseline understanding of how to use it to build better software!

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git. GitHub is focused on developers, the people who code and create software. Our focus is also the people who partner with and employ developers, who are encouraging them to build amazing things.

We do all we can to help unlock the creativity of developers and to foster a community of developers that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.

GitHub concentrates on three things:

- Building a technology platform that is like no other, on which developers can create, share and grow the best code possible
- Nurturing a community for developers; a safe and collaborative place that facilitates sharing, amplifies creativity, and supports the principles of open source
- Providing access, opening up a community of opportunity, where new developers can be born and where experienced developers can hone their skills and expand their knowledge
